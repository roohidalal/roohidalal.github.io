{% include base_path %}

I am passionate about improving equity and inclusion in astronomy and physics, and am involved in a number of projects in my department and around the university. Please reach out to me if you'd like to chat about any of these, if you have any ideas for improvements or changes we could be making to these programs, or if you would like to collaborate on any initiatives! 

# Princeton Astrophysics Departmental Climate Committee
As a graduate student representative on the Astrophysics department climate committee, I helped develop, administer and report on the results of a biennial department-wide climate survey. I also spearheaded initiatives to respond to the issues raised by the survey, including developing a code of conduct, working with the graduate admissions committee to make the process more equitable, leading a working group to reconsider iconography in the department, and mentoring undergraduate and incoming graduate students.

# Women in STEM Leadership Council
The Women in STEM Leadership Council is comprised of the leaders of various department women in STEM groups on campus and is convened by the Graduate School Diversity and Inclusion team. As a member and former president of the group, I have led initiatives to improve equity in the graduate admissions and faculty hiring processes, to increase awareness of reporting resources for graduate students, and to provide better protections for students in harmful advising relationships.

# Graduate Scholars Program
I was a peer mentor for a group of first-year graduate students from diverse backgrounds. I helped support them through the transition to graduate school, connected them to helpful resources on campus, and organized community-building events.

# Caltech Women in Physics, Math and Astronomy
I helped found the Women in Physics, Math and Astronomy organization at Caltech. As a member of the organizing committee, I planned professional development workshops, journal clubs on social justice issues, and mentoring/networking events.
