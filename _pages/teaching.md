## Teaching
I have taken opportunities to develop my skills as a teacher in both undergrad and grad school. I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses:
* AST 255 - Life in the Universe (Princeton, Fall 2021)
* AST 204 - Topics in Modern Astronomy (Princeton, Fall 2021) 
* Ay 1 - The Evolving Universe (Caltech, Spring 2017, Spring 2018)
* Ph2b - Quantum Mechanics (Caltech, Winter 2018)

In addition to being a teaching assistant, I have also worked one-on-one with students from Pasadena public schools struggling with math and science through the Caltech Y RISE Program (2014-18). During my time at Caltech, I was also a tutor with the Hixon Writing Center, where I worked with students and researchers on developing their academic writing skills through both one-on-one tutoring and group workshops.


## Advising
I have had the pleasure of working with two students on their undergraduate summer research projects and junior papers. 

### Jupiter Ding - Miscentering of HSC CAMIRA clusters based on ACT SZ counterparts 
For his 2022 Princeton Undergraduate Summer Research Program project, and his subsequent Junior Paper, Jupiter is studying the 
miscentering effect in optical galaxy cluster finding algorithms. He has cross-matched the CAMIRA cluster catalog from the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey 
with a catalog of SZ clusters from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, resulting in a sample of nearly 200 clusters. He has used this sample to show that 
about 25% of CAMIRA clusters have a center that is significantly offset from the SZ center, in agreement with previous miscentering studies with 
smaller samples. Jupiter is now exploring the potential causes of the miscentering, and has found that miscentered clusters are 2x more likely to be 
merging, and that observational artifacts and bright star masks can also significantly impact the determination of the cluster center. This miscentering 
effect is important to model in cluster lensing studies, and can also impact our studies of Brightest Cluster Galaxies, and Jupiter is making important 
contributions to our understanding of the effect. Jupiter recently received a Chambliss Award for his presentation of this work at AAS 241. Keep an eye 
out for his paper, which we hope will be out soon!

### Savannah Pobre - Understanding tests of Brightest Cluster Galaxy "specialness"
As a participant in the 2021 Princeton Undergraduate Summer Research Program, and for her Junior Paper, Savannah looked at tests we can use to 
ascertain whether Brightest Cluster Galaxies are consistent with being drawn from the luminosity distribution of other galaxies in the galaxy cluster, or 
whether they have their own "special" distribution. Savannah examined one particular test of BCG specialness, the Tremaine-Richstone (TR) statistics, to 
understand why there are cases in which the two statistics can suggest different conclusions about BCG specialness, and to determine which of the two 
statistics is more reliable in these situations. She used simulations of galaxy clusters with known luminosity distributions and BCG properties to 
find that the first TR statistic is more reliable than the second, which will be important for future studies of BCG properties to keep in mind! 
Savannah's work is now [published](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/acb9e1) in the Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society.
