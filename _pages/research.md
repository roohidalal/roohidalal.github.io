My scientific interests include constraining cosmology from cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, as well as studies of galaxy cluster properties and cluster cosmology. I am a member of both the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaborations, and am also interested in multi-probe cosmological analyses that utilize cross-correlations of cosmic shear, galaxy clustering, CMB lensing and Compton-y maps. I have also been engaged in a number of projects related to [science and space policy](../science_policy).

# Cosmic Shear

I am currently leading the HSC Year 3 analysis of cosmic shear in Fourier space. Cosmic shear is a measure of the coherent distortion of light from distant galaxies due to gravitational lensing by the large scale structure of the universe. Cosmic shear is a direct probe of the matter power spectrum, and can therefore be used to constrain the matter fraction in the universe, $\Omega_m$, and the amplitude of density fluctuations on the scale of 8 Mpc/h, $\sigma_8$. My cosmic shear analysis will provide leading constraints on $S_8 = \sigma_8 \sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, which will be an important step towards understanding the apparent tension between values of $S_8$ inferred from lensing surveys and those from CMB experiments. In HSC, we are doing the analysis in both real space (using the two point correlation function) and in Fourier space (using the angular power spectrum). It is important to carry out the analysis using both methods, as they are sensitive to different scales and systematic effects, and therefore complementary to each other. We are aiming to have both these analyses out (along with the 3x2pt analysis combining cosmic shear with galaxy-galaxy lensing and galaxy clustering) by Spring 2023. 

In addition to the measurement and analysis of the cosmic shear data vector, I am also involved in projects thinking about the systematics that can contaminate this measurement. In addition to excellent its excellent seeing conditions, HSC is deepest precursor survey to the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, so we are starting to see not only the strength of the data, but also all the systematic effects that we will have to worry about when doing our cosmological analyses. I have contributed to our measurement of the sample redshift distribution, which uses clustering redshifts from a Luminous Red Galaxy sample, in addition to the photometric information we have for our full galaxy sample, to better constrain the distances to the galaxies we are using to measure cosmic shear. I have also worked on our model for biases in the cosmic shear measurement caused by the Point Spread Function (PSF). Although cosmic shear measurements have traditionally only modeled the impact of the second moments of the PSF, we extend the systematics model to higher moments and show that, for HSC Y3, the fourth moment PSF leakage term is the dominant contributor to the bias on the cosmic shear data vector, and that not correcting for this term can lead to significant biases in our cosmological parameter inference.
