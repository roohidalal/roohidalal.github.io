My scientific interests include constraining cosmology from cosmic shear and galaxy clustering, as well as studies of galaxy cluster properties and cluster cosmology. I am a member of both the Hyper Suprime-Cam and Atacama Cosmology Telescope collaborations, and am also interested in multi-probe cosmological analyses that utilize cross-correlations of cosmic shear, galaxy clustering, CMB lensing and Compton-y maps. I have also been engaged in a number of projects related to [science and space policy](science_policy).
