I am passionate about science policy, particularly issues related to the safe and sustainable use of outer space, including space debris and space traffic management, as well as minimizing light pollution from satellite mega-constellations. Some of the initiatives I have taken and the projects I am involved in related to these topics are described below.

## Certificate in Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy

Alongside my PhD in Astrophysics, I am working towards a Certificate in Science, Technology, and Environmental Policy. Through this program, I have taken classes on Weapons of Mass Destruction as well as Space Security and Policy. These classes have improved my understanding of the history of space policy and how this has informed current approaches to space regulation, while also giving me an appreciation for how dependent we are on space, particularly from a nuclear stability perspective. As a part of these classes, I have worked on projects related to the threat posed by space debris to nuclear strategic stability (see below), and the need for a clearer definition of "outer space" given the growth of new technologies such as hypersonics, fractional orbital bombardment systems and space planes. In Spring 2023, I will be taking a class on global environmental governance, which will give me a better understanding of the legal landscape for protection of the space environment.

## Space Debris and Nuclear Strategic Stability

There is a significant and growing amount of debris in space, much of which is smaller than our tracking limits (there are estimated to be 130 million pieces of debris smaller than 1 cm). I am currently working on a project to understand the danger posed by this debris field to nuclear command, control and communications satellites, both in terms of the potential for collisions and what types of damage such collisions could cause. Given that small, untrackable debris pieces have the capacity to cause debilitating damage to satellites, I address the question of whether we would be able to distinguish between a satellite failure due to a collision with debris, and failure due to intentional interference with the satellite, noting that an inability to do so could lead to inadvertent nuclear escalation. I recommend technologies that could be used to attribute satellite failures to debris impacts, and suggest changes to the 1972 Liability Convention to disincentivize debris production. 

I have also been thinking about the consequences of the debris generated by tests of anti-satellite weapons and ballistic missile defense, particularly as we expect the number of satellites operating in Very Low Earth Orbits (VLEO) to grow.

## AAS LPRISD Policy Subcommittee

I am a member of the policy subcommittee of the American Astronomical Society's Committee on Light Pollution, Radio Interference, and Space Debris. In this role, I am engaged in discussions on minimizing the impact of satellite mega-constellations on ground-based astronomy. I have been looking into the impacts that satellites like SpaceX's Starlink constellation and AST SpaceMobile's BlueWalker 3 could have on our ability to collect astronomical data from the ground. I am also thinking about the ways in which the FCC licensing process could be updated to better account for the impacts of such satellites on the space environment, and the potential atmospheric impacts of deorbiting large numbers of satellites.
