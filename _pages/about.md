I am an astronomer working to advance security and sustainability in outer space. As a postdoctoral fellow at the Outer Space Institute and University of British Columbia, I am studying the intersections of nuclear and space security, modeling orbital debris, and pursuing policy pathways for protecting the night sky from light pollution. As a Vice Chair of the American Astronomical Society's [Committee for the Protection of Astronomy and the Space Environment](https://aas.org/comms/committee-for-protection-astronomy-space-environment), I am leading the society's policy efforts in terms of mitigating light pollution from satellite constellations, orbital debris, and the other environmental impacts of our uses of outer space. I am also a Next-Generation Fellow of the [Physicists' Coalition for Nuclear Threat Reduction](https://physicistscoalition.org/), though which I am developing technical standards for an anti-satellite weapons testing ban and modeling debris production from ballistic missile defense intercepts.

When I'm not working on space policy, I study dark matter and dark energy using large surveys of galaxies. Through my involvement in the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey, I am improving our understanding of a number of observational and theoretical systematic effects that can contaminate weak gravitational lensing measurements. I recently led the [cosmic shear power spectrum analysis](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.123519) for the Year 3 data release of the Hyper-Suprime Cam survey, which placed some of the strongest constraints to date on the clustering of dark matter.
