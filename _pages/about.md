I am a fourth-year graduate student in the Department of Astrophysical Sciences at Princeton University. I am interested in both cosmology and science policy. On the cosmology front, I am interested in constraining dark matter and dark energy from large surveys of galaxies, using both weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. I am leading analyses of cosmic shear and galaxy clustering for the Year 3 data release of the Hyper-Suprime Cam survey, and am thinking about how we can extract precise cosmological constraints from our data while also carefully modeling systematic effects that can contaminate our measurements.  

In terms of science policy, I am deeply interested in space policy and questions related to the sustainable use of outer space. I am studying the effects of space debris on nuclear strategic stability, particularly the potential for small pieces of debris to have undetectable but debilitating impacts with nuclear command, control, and communications satellites. As a member of the policy subcommittee of the AAS Committee on Light Pollution, Radio Interference and Space Debris, I am also involved in discussions and initiatives related to the impacts of satellite constellations on ground-based astronomical observations.
